# Dynamic Programming: Topic Introduction

**Dynamic programming** (**DP**) is an extremely useful technique.
  * ***N.B.*** Students often have trouble with this topic, however, with sufficient practice, it will become more intuitive and familiar. The lectures will also demonstrate illustrative examples for this purpose.

The ***key*** to mastering dynamic programming is to perform lots of practice problems. While the homeworks are a starting point, do additional textbook problems and other references (e.g., textbooks, courses, etc.) for further practice.

The ***outline*** for this section is as follows:
  * **Fibonacci numbers** → This is a "toy example" to illustrate the basic idea of dynamic programming
  * Subsequently to computing Fibonacci numbers, we will dive into a variety of example problems to get a feel for the different styles of dynamic programming algorithms, including:
    * **Longest Increasing Subsequence** (**LIS**)
    * **Longest Common Subsequence** (**LCS**)
    * **Knapsack**
    * **Chain Matrix Multiplication**
    * **Shortest Path Algorithms**

Given an integer $n$, we wil look at an algorithm for generating the corresponding $n$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number. This is a very simple algorithm, but it will illustrate the idea of dynamic programming; later we will examine dynamic programming more generally (i.e., techniques for designing a dynamic programming algorithm, as well as more sophisticated examples).

Recall that the Fibonacci numbers are the following sequence:

$0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, \cdots$

There is a simple recursive formula that defines the Fibonacci numbers as follows:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{array}{l}
{F_{0} = 0,\ F_{1} = 1}\\
{\rm{for}\ n > 1:}\\
\ \ \ \ {F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}}
\end{array}
}
$$

Furthermore:
  * ***Input***: integer $n \ge 0$
  * ***Output***: $n$<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci number

We want an ***efficient*** algorithm to achieve this goal/output. Therefore, we are aiming for a ***running time*** which is ***polynomial*** in $n$ .

Since the Fibonacci numbers are defined by this simple recursive formula, we might therefore think that a recursive algorithm is a natural algorithm for this particular problem. We will look at this recursive algorithm next, as well as analyze it accordingly.
